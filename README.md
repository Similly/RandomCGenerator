# Random C++ Generator

## Variable was not declared

One error why I can't run my generated program is because that some assignment statement try to assign values to variables which had never been declared before.

## Declared variable is never used

The generator generates declaration statement to declare variables. But the declared variables are never used most of the time, so the most variables are completely useless.

## Generated program is useless

The generator can't generate programs which do useful things. That is because the set of statements to generate is limited. The generator can only declare variables and assign values to it and I can't think of any case in which this can create a useful program.
